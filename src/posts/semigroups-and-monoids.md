As I work through the list of writeups to teach lattice-based crypto, I may touch on certain topics that may not be directly useful neither at a high-level, nor during implementation.

But nevertheless, I do think that it is indeed helpful to familiarize oneself with some of the vocabularies that mathematicians use for communicating certain ideas.

In another [post](https://blog.salrahman.com/posts/2025/09/fields-and-rings), I talk about rings and fields.
