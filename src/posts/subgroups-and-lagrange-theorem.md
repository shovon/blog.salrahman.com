title: "Helpful topic to teach yourself lattice-based crypto: subgroups and Lagrange's theorem"
summary: "If we are motivated enough to find subdivisions of a group, we can subdivide them into subgroups. But we can't just do this blindly; there are certain discovered and implied of rules of math that makes arbitrary division of groups highly difficult. This article goes over some detailed overview of Lagrange's theorem, which should serve as a gateway towards other topics."

In other [post](https://blog.salrahman.com/posts/2025/09/groups), we have been introduced to groups.

Now you may ask, can we subdivide groups? Yes you can! Is that subdivision guaranteed to be a group themselves? Only under certain circumstances, and it is entirely on a case-by-case basis on certain sets. Not all groups can cleanly be subdivided into other groups.

But if they are, they most certainly serve as an interesting focus of study, which we will explore further in another post.
