title: "Helpful topic to teach yourself lattice-based crypto: quotient groups"
summary: "We have integers. They form a group. Then we can sub-divide them even more to get subgroups and cosets. What they are is going to discussed in this article."

In another post, I [talked about groups](https://blog.salrahman.com/posts/2025/09/groups).

As a refresher, groups are a generalization of [rings](https://blog.salrahman.com/posts/2025/09/fields-and-rings) (and rings are a generalization of fields). Recall that rings have both an additive group and a multiplicative semigroup or a monoid, but groups alone are defined by some additive group. For an added refresher, groups are defined as sets equipped with a single operation that is closed, associative, has an identity element, and where every element has an inverse.

A property of many groups is that they can have what are known as subgroups.

In order for something to be satisfy the definition of a subgroup, it must first and foremost be a set, and second, it must be a group.
