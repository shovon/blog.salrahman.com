title: "What I value more than clean code"
summary: "Throughout my software engineering career, I'd hear this oft-repeated complaint from way too many people: code is hard to read. But should we always listen to this complaint, or should we just let them pass?"

Previously, I wrote about [code being ephemeral](https://blog.salrahman.com/posts/2024/11/ephemerality-of-code).

I have so much more thoughts about code cleanliness.

Especially considering that TypeScript is now ever growing in popularity, and it may one day outpace JavaScript in adoption.

As its popularity grows, the signals of it being a highly liked programming language also comes with the noise from those who dislike it.

I've heard many dissenting opinion from TypeScript haters, but one complaint that I hear alot (but not necessarily the biggest complaint) is that TypeScript makes code harder to read.

After all, JavaScript never introduced type annotations. For this reason, I have to admit, the language looks perhaps a lot less "cluttered" than typed languages such as Java, C#, and C++.

And among those who argue that JavaScript looks cleaner, in their eyes, TypeScript looks a lot messier.

If clean code is to be striving for, then surely TypeScript is a step backward.

And it's for that reason why I don't strive for clean code, at least, by the metric of how "cluttered" things look. And to me, the concept of "appearance" feels arbitrary. How do you define "appearance"?

## What's the ideal metric, then?

For me, the ideal metric to strive for is how easy it is to reason about the code.

A simple example is a function. In a dynamically typed language, there is no way to determine the type of a particular value.
